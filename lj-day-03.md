#Code 201 Day 3
Day 3
I got my ass kicked today by For loops. I could not for the life of me figure out the syntax for double for loops. I knew i would have trouble but not this much. I really need to be better about that 15 minute rule. Big thanks to Duncan for helping me out when he was on he way out. You the man Duncan. I need to do some more CSS practice but tonight assignment took me too long. Again though as frustrating as this is and how hard that struggle was, i got through it and mostly solved my issues. I'm excited for what's to come.
