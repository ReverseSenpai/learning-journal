#First learning-journal
Day 2 LJ
So far its seems that we're progressing kind of slow but at the same time ive also forgotten a couple of the smaller things. I certainly dont feel in the pit yet. But maybe thats just because weve only covered stuff that the prework and 101 went over. First assignment i messed up in my interpretation of the the requirements. But after that ive not been lost for assignments so thats good. Textbook isnt a giant pain to read though i do see what Duncan meant about maybe too much info i find myself drifting from text to pictures frequently. Missed a couple points on the quiz so im gonna go review the text book and work on acing it. Nothing more beyond that besides to make sure not to get complacent and keep working hard. ALso i need to sleep more.
