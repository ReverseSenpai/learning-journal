#First learning-journal
Day 2 LJ
So far its seems that we're progressing kind of slow but at the same time I've also forgotten a couple of the smaller things. I certainly don't feel in the pit yet. But maybe that's just because we've only covered stuff that the pre-work and 101 went over. First assignment I messed up in my interpretation of the requirements. But after that I've not been lost for assignments so that's good. Textbook isn't a giant pain to read though I do see what Duncan meant about maybe too much info I find myself drifting from text to pictures frequently. Missed a couple points on the quiz so I'm gonna go review the text book and work on acing it. Nothing more beyond that besides to make sure not to get complacent and keep working hard. Also I need to sleep more. Way more
